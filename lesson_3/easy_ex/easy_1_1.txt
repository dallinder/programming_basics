numbers = [1, 2, 2, 3]
numbers.uniq

puts numbers

This problem puts out:

1
2
2
3

The reason is that puts converts the array to a string. And uniq does not mutate the original numbers array. To make it print out a new array with [1, 2, 3], you would have to do this:

numbers = [1, 2, 2, 3]
numbers.uniq!

p numbers
